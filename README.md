# Sorting Algorithms Comparison

### Array

Array that all of the algorithms struggle was genereted completly randomly by the following code:

```python3
from numpy import random

arr = list(random.randint(1337, size=(12)))

arr 

In [1] [1160, 563, 916, 736, 658, 81, 1104, 302, 787, 58, 1220, 1149]

sorted(arr)

In [2] [58, 81, 302, 563, 658, 736, 787, 916, 1104, 1149, 1160, 1220]

```
